Proper estimation of offshore piles is vital to the life and permanence of the foundation in question. However, due to the uncertainties of soil parameters in the field, the offshore piles are greatly effected. The source of soil uncertainties may come from various reasons, such as  lack of uniformity between in-situ test and laboratory  experiment; spatial variability of soil profile and rationality of the constitutive model, etc. Traditional statistical analysis is based on Monte Carlo, which is time-consuming and laborious. Even if Bayesian theorem provides a possible tool to understand and update the uncertainties for the priors, the amount of the inference analysis is still computationally heavy, thus bring big challenges for the pile design.

In this thesis, we hope to introduce Markov Chain process involving in Bayesian inverse analysis to reduce the inverse analysis time and provide reasonable posterior results for the soil parameters. Based on Markov Chain process, we also introduce the Reward function and Action function to form the basis of digital twin. Combined with monitored data, the proposed probabilistic graph model-Partially Observed Markov Decision Process can be used to mimic and predict the pile bearing behaviors.
