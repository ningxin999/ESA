\section{Objectives}

Introduce Markov Chain process involving in Bayesian inverse analysis to reduce the inverse analysis time and provide reasonable posterior results for the soil parameters. Based on Markov Chain process, we also introduce the Reward function and Action function to form the basis of digital twin. Combined with monitored data, the proposed probabilistic graph model-Partially Observed Markov Decision Process can be used to mimic and predict the pile bearing behaviors.
